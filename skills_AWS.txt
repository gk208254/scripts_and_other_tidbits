Myself Gaurav Kumar. I have experience of 4 years and 8 months. I have been working as Cloud Engineer at TCS. Before this organization I have worked in HCL. I am 2x Microsoft Certified Azure Administrator. I also have 3 associate level certs in AWS. and 2 certs in GitHub (GitHub foundations and GitHub actions). I am currently working on the AWS Cloud, handling both Windows and Linux operating systems.  I have been working with Terraform for infrastructure as code (IaC), managing our infrastructure codebase on GitHub, and deploying it via GitHub Actions CI/CD pipelines. Additionally, I have foundational knowledge of Docker and Kubernetes. in previous projects, I have worked on Azure and VMware as well.

So my day to day responsibilities includes the following:

Provisioning AWS infrastructure, which involves configuring Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs), subnets, security groups, route tables, Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) instances, S3 buckets, AWS Key Management Service (KMS), AWS WAF, Elastic Load Balancers (ELB), Application Load Balancers (ALB), and Virtual Private Network (VPN) gateways, along with other associated components.

have helped teams to adopt GitHub Actions (GHA) workflows.
As our codebase is hosted on GitHub:-
I have experience in setting up branch protection rules, managing access permissions.

create dev and test env for dev teams
where we deploy vnets, subnets, vms, storage account, azure file shares, azure recovery service vaults, azure key vaults
here we have hub vnet where firewall is deployed, tier zero (which we refer to as 

So the project in which i was involved we deployed multi-env multi-tier application,
where we deployed separate vnets for dev, test, uat and shared lower vnet (whatelse was there)?? for database and shared vms for lower environment
we had shared

shared higher
tier0
for directory services(AD)
it was hub and spoke where shared was hub peered with all the spoke (firewall was deployed in this subnet)
firewall -> internal application gateway
we had vdi/remote desktop that we used VMware horizon that was deployed in the other
integration of that with the existing infra
